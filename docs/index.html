    <h1>Displaying HTML Files in GitHub</h1>

  <b>Note</b>:<i> I didn't create these instructions, I cribbed them from <a href="https://www.finex.co/how-to-display-html-in-github/">FinEx.Co</a>, but let's move right along.</i>
<br><br>          <div>
1. Navigate to your default GitHub /[userID].github.io repository. Mine is sasrza.github.io
<br>
  2. Create a subfolder called /docs for your html files to reside in. If you're confused, <a href="https://github.com/KirstieJane/STEMMRoleModels/wiki/Creating-new-folders-in-GitHub-repository-via-the-browser">look here</a>.
  <br>
  3. Create an index.html file in this subfolder using the technique above. Put anything (ie: Hello World) in it. Commit it.
  <br>
  4. Now drop the rest of your html files in this same folder. You can write in GH web or upload from machine.
  <br>
  5. In the Settings for the Repository, go to scroll down to the GitHub Pages section.
  <br>
  6. A message will appear that your site is read to be published. Click on the link.
  <br>
  7. When Git finds the index.html file in a docs/ folder, it creates a web address for the contents. The address takes the form: http://username.github.io/repository
  <br>
 8. Go to that address. You should see your “Hello World” greeting. That is your index.html file.
  <br>
  9. Go back to the docs/ folder and open it. Upload another HTML file if you haven't yet. Commit it.
  <br>
  10. Return to your github.io site but add the HTML file name to the address: http://username.github.io/repository/filename.html.
  <br>
  11. My example is https://sasrza.github.io/docs/hello.html and that displays the HTML file as expected.
  <br><br>    </div>
  <b>Note</b>:<i> It can take a couple of minutes to see your changes after you commit them.</i>
